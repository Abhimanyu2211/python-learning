# Python Learning Journey (Days 1–3)

This repository contains my Python practice as I learn the basics from scratch.  
I completed 15+ programs across three days, covering core Python concepts and a small mini-project.

## Contents
- Day 1: Variables, Data Types, Operators  
- Day 2: Conditions, Loops, Functions  
- Day 3: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries  

## Mini Project
**Snake–Water–Gun Game**  
A simple game built using Python's `random` module and conditional logic.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 snake_water_gun.py
